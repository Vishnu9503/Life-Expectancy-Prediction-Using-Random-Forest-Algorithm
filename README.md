# Life-Expectancy-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Algorithm
Welcome to the Life Expectancy Prediction project! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on diverse factors such as demographics, healthcare data, and socioeconomic indicators. The predictive model, built using Random Forest regression, is deployed as a user-friendly web application, making accurate life expectancy predictions accessible to individuals, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.

##Key Features:

Robust Modeling: Utilizes Random Forest regression for accurate and interpretable predictions.
User-Friendly Web App: A well-designed web interface allows users to input data and receive personalized predictions.
Real-Time Updates: The system accommodates real-time data updates to enhance prediction accuracy.
Security Measures: Implements encryption and access controls for user data privacy.


##Contribute:

We welcome contributions! Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.
##Documentation:

Detailed documentation is available to guide users on using the web application and understanding the model.
